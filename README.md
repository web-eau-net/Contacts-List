# Contacts-List
The easiest way to display a list of contacts in Joomla!

Displaying a list of contacts on your Joomla website is very useful to promote a department or a team, for example. The module Contacts list gives you the opportunity to display their names, avatar, position and email addresses, if needed. And you can select the contacts to display by their category, if needed. Also, there are many design options to present your contacts on your website.
This is a powerful tool to engage your visitors to contact your team through your site.
